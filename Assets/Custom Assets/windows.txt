1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I keep my windows open when I sleep

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,820
I like being cold and hearing the rain

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,340
And I've moved a lot in the past few years

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,880
The longest I've stayed in a place was my one bedroom apartment on 5th ave

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,320
It's a major street that runs downtown

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,740
And to a number of hospitals

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,300
Train tracks run parallel to the road

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
Then I moved to Ohio

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,140
It was strange and quiet

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,140
So dark

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,500
I had a hard time adjusting to the silence

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,160
And then the relationship that moved me there shattered

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,120
I left Ohio and had to stay with my parents while I was between places

14
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,420
In their new home by the woods

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,500
It was loud

16
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,980
Like I was used to

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,980
But with unfamiliar noise

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,360
I moved back to the city in the beginning of November

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
It was a warm November

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,820
My windows were open - the rain falling outside

21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,820
I finally felt at home again

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,160
And when I could hear the train again

23
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,500
My heart soared
